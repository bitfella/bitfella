                        Since I was a kid, I&apos;ve been a very curious dude, always searching for something new to
                        discover, understand, learn, master. I&apos;ve grown up as a human being interested in
                        <em>collaboration rather than competition</em>, not much excited by titles, with a strong desire
                        to create things that people may actually use and enjoy, instead of just &ldquo;go to work
                        and earn some money&rdquo;.
